# U304AA-RadiantCore-ATT
AT&amp;T Radiant Core model U304AA partition dumps and other related


Partitions dumped using MTK Client (https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient)

I included only a few of the partitions since some of the others are quite large, even when compressed, but 
should be enough for a TWRP or to root (it's 3am, finding it difficult to remember my name, let alone what's required)

For the remainder of the dump, I can upload via external host if requested.  


This is a very low-end android, but AT&T was giving them out for free for a while, and there's a lot out there.
Created the repository because I could not find any of the firmware anywhere (and my google-fu is quite strong...)
